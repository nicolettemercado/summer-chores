# Summer Chores Simulation

This is a simple JavaScript project that utilizes callback functions to simulate a person's summer chore routine.

## Chores include:

1. Mowing the yard (2000 ms)
2. Weed control in the yard (1500 ms)
3. Trimming the hedges (1000 ms)
4. Collecting wood (2500 ms)
5. Watering the garden (500 ms)

Each chore has the chance to make the person fall asleep after completion, with the exception of the first chore which will always be completed. 

## How It's Made:

Tech used: JavaScript, Callback functions, VS Code
